# Rate My Prof

A simple Rails 5 app for rating professors.

## Running the App

This app requires Ruby 2.3.5 and Rails 5.2.0. Currently it only uses the built-in SQLite database.

Clone or download this repo, `cd` into the top-level directory, then run the app using `rails server` (or `rails s` for short).
